## About

My son and youngest daughter have joined a bouldering club. We've been going regularly for the past few months, and they've been improving steadily.

However, the other week they were lacking motivation... until they were given Bingo cards.

What a difference it made! Immediately, they were racing to check off their challenges, just to be the first to shout 'House!'. The other climbers may have looked at us as though we were a little crazy, but it was a lot of fun.

In the interest of keeping them motivated to climb, getting me motivated to practice using Material-UI, and saving some trees along the way, I decided to build a little phone app to create on-line bingo cards.

If your kids climb, or maybe you do (the difficulty of the challenges is customizable), you can give it a try at [boulderbingo.vercel.app](https://boulderbingo.vercel.app/).

## How To Play

Choose how many challenges to attempt, then select which types to face.
Include routes by colour, climb the intro runs, choose by difficulty, even add exercises.

Challenges are added randomly to the bingo card. Don&apos;t like the way it looks? Just hit shuffle.


## Dependencies
- Next
- Material-UI
- Redux Toolkit
- Framer-Motion

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
